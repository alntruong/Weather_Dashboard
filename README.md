# Weather_Dashboard

This weather dashboard application was made using Visual Studio Code with bootstrap as its main CSS framework.

The purpose of this application is to allow the user to search up their city and have information about the current status of the weather displayed.
In addition, the user is presented with the 5-day weather forecast for that city. [Not done]

My motivation for this project was to work on my Javascript knowledge because it is an area that I feel uncomfortable with.
An issue that I encountered along the way was that not all informations like UV index and weather icon followed the same method, but instead required additional steps.
I also learned that I really should not be fixated on the design of the website, but instead focus more on the getting the site to work first. I only mention this because time was very limited and I could have always gone back and done some touch ups after all the functionality was complete.
