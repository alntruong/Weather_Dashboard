Good README file

A README needs to answer the following what, why, and how:
What was your motivation?
Why did you build this project?
What problem does it solve?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.

The quality of a README desccription often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
